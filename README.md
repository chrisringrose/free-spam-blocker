# Free Spam Blocker for WordPress

A tiny and lightweight spam blocker for WordPress. Install this plugin, and walk away.

## What it does

Simply put, this is an anti-spam plugin, designed to limit the junk mail you get from the email forms on your WordPress website.

### How it works

Most spam isn't from real people typing in annoying messages on your website - it's from "bots". Bots are computer programs that scour the internet, looking for every fillable form they can find. Once a fillable form is found on your website, bots submit their pre-written spam message.

But bots have a weakness: most of them ignore the JavaScript on your website. JavaScript is the fancy code that makes your website come to life, with things like animating sliders, or dropdown menus. Many major websites today require JavaScript just to use the website.

Since most bots ignore JavaScript, this anti-spam solution makes your fillable form require JavaScript.


### Installation

Install it via the WordPress plugin install page:

1. Log into your WordPress page with admin access.
2. Go to the **Plugins** tab on the left in WordPress.
3. Click **Add New** (Located near the top of the page)
4. In the **Search plugins** box, type **Free Spam Blocker**
5. Click **Install Now**, and then click **Activate**

### Manual install

You can bypass the WordPress plugin system, if you have admin access to your hosted WordPress site. Download this repository, unzip it, and copy this "free-spam-blocker" folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder.
